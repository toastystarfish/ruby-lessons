# In this lesson I'll show you some of the mathematical operations you can use

# multiplication
assert_equal __, 2 * 3

# addition
assert_equal __, 2 + 1

# subtraction
assert_equal __, 10 - 8

# divide
assert_equal __, 10 / 2
# division with integers will result in an integer
assert_equal __, 9 / 2
# if you divide by a decimal the result will be as expected
assert_equal __, 9 / 2.0

# modulus operator
assert_equal __, 6 % 4
assert_equal __, 4 % 4

assert_equ

# addition to a variable in place
x = 0
x = x + 3
assert_equal __, x

x = 0
x += 3
assert_equal __, x

x = 3
x = x - 2
assert_equal __, x

x = 3
x -= 2
assert_equal __, x

# negative numbers

assert_equal __, 0 - 2
